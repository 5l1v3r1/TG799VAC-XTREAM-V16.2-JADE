lo Gentoo friends. I have been added installations scripts for gl/pzs-ng back to my git, sorry it toke THAT long time to re-upload them (just toke 2years? ;P).. Go grab the scripts here https://github.com/wuseman/wglftpd .. Let me know if things works as expected. Also alot of various scripts from different fellas was added earlier this week..



Eggdrop and all other stuff will also get re-upped later but not right now. Atleast you can get things up and running within ~30seconds again. Pzs-ng and imdb features is supposed to work aswell.Will add it to wuseman-overlay later.. Questions? Feel free to pm me. For faster replies you will find me on @freenode #Gentoo, k thx
